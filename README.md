In this exercise, you will construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition by using Traffic Sign Recognition Dataset (TSRD.zip). This dataset consists of 1770 traffic sign images from 7 categories. Each image is a zoomed view of a single traffic sign. Annotations provide image properties as well as traffic sign coordinates within image and category.
